### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1643516275/23058/wave.gif?1643516275" width="25"/>

I'm **Sam**, a passionate web developer with a keen eye for detail and a drive to deliver high-quality, scalable web solutions. 

I specialize in building seamless and efficient e-commerce platforms on Shopify, where I'm a registered partner, and I'm equally fascinated by the world of 3D web design. My favorite programming language is Python, but I also enjoy working with JavaScript, especially when creating interactive games and engaging user experiences.

Outside of coding, Iâ€™m always eager to expand my knowledge in tech. However, I also make sure to spend quality time with my wife and two kids as we travel across Southeast Asia.

#### Fun Facts:
- I can solve a Rubik's cube in under 2 minutes.
- I only drink black coffee.
- I'm a proud Mac user.
- I'm currently traveling Southeast Asia with my family.

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you want to collaborate on a project or just chat about tech and travel!
